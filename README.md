## About this project

We selected the theme `Better Learning` to improve the knowledge around politics in Brazil. 
Our app tries to make the politics subject, usually seen as something complicated and 
boring, fun and easier to understand.

Using cards and quizzes, you are capable of exploring different topics about the political 
organization of our country, such as political roles or how laws are made. By completing 
these quizzes, you can win achievements and see your progress inside the app.

Besides that, we want to create a more accessible platform for the population to be updated
about our politician's acts. With the app, the user can rate their representatives on how 
well they accomplished each of their goals and then win points that can be converted into 
tax discounts.
