## About this project
We selected the theme `Better Learning` to improve the knowledge around politics in Brazil.
Our app tries to make the politics subject, usually seen as something complicated and
boring, fun and easier to understand.

Using card and quizzes, our user can explore differents topics about the political 
organization, such as political roles or how laws are made. Completing this quizzes, the
user can win achievements and see their progress inside the app.

Besides that, we want to create a more accessible plataform for the population to be 
updated about our politician's acts. With the app, the user can rate their representants
on how well they accomplished each of their goals and then win points that can be 
converted into tax discounts.
